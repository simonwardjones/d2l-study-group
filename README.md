# Deep Learning Study Group

### About
In this free online study program, we will be studying the ["Dive into Deep Learning"](https://d2l.ai/index.html) book by Aston Zhang, Zack C. Lipton, Mu Li, and Alex J. Smola.

All study sessions will be free and fully-remote. All sessions will be recorded and uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyna_OxOWL7IEuOwb7WhmxQ?view_as=subscriber). 

Unlike other study groups, the format (tentative) will be as follows:
- Chapters will be presented with slides, which will be followed by code walkthroughs 
- For every session, there will be a segment for discussion and Q&A
- After every session, we will assign take-home exercises corresponding to the material covered in that session. Solutions should be uploaded to GitHub. (More instructions coming soon!)
- Before every session, we will provide a list of extra reading material that will be helpful for the upcoming session
- We plan to have guest lectures and presentations to provide additional practical value to students (TBA)
- There will be **one final project** which will be done in groups. The groups have to present their work towards the end of the program. (More information coming soon!)

### Instructions
- Make sure to join our [Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/dairai/shared_invite/zt-dv2dwzj7-F9HT047jIGkunNKv88lQ~g) (channel: **#d2l-study-group**) for the latest schedule, updates and announcements. 
- We will take attendance and you will be eligible to receive a **Certificate of Completion** if you complete more than 80% of the exercises. We won't use any kind of grading system. We hope that all submissions of the exercises are true attempts to complete them. We will provide feedback on all submissions to help with completion when needed. 
- You are free to audit the sessions as well.
