### Updating my branch

Not great practise to change the history of the remote but I expect to be the only one using this.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```


### Notes

 - I am using conda for this project (see bash file for setup)
    ```bash
    conda activate d2l
    conda deactivate
    ```
 - Installed MacTex and added to path: `export PATH="/Library/TeX/texbin:$PATH"`
